# 👨‍💼 WiredBrainCoffee ☕

The WiredBrainCoffee project is a software project that simulates an online coffee shop. It utilizes WPF and ASP.Net on the backend, both popular Microsoft technologies.

# 🏗️ Backend Framework 🗿

The WiredBrainCoffee project's backend is built using WPF and ASP.Net, providing a robust and scalable foundation for the project.

# 💪 SOLID and Clean Architecture Principles

In this project, I made a concerted effort to follow SOLID and clean architecture principles. By adhering to these principles, I was able to create a codebase that is maintainable and scalable. The code is self-documented and readable, making it easy for others to understand and maintain.

# 🧪 MVVM Implementation

To further improve the maintainability and testability of the WPF frontend, I implemented MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. This allowed me to separate the concerns of the application's logic, presentation, and data. By doing so, I was able to improve the scalability and testability of the codebase.

# 📖 Detailed Explanation

The WiredBrainCoffee project is an online coffee shop simulation built using WPF and ASP.Net. The project's backend provides a robust and scalable foundation for the application.

To further improve the codebase's maintainability and scalability, I followed SOLID and clean architecture principles. Additionally, I implemented MVVM design pattern for the WPF frontend. This separated the concerns of the application's logic, presentation, and data, making it easier to test and modify the codebase over time.

# 👍 Conclusion

The WiredBrainCoffee project is an excellent example of how to develop a scalable and maintainable codebase using Microsoft technologies. By following SOLID and clean architecture principles and implementing MVVM, I was able to create a codebase that is well-structured and easy to maintain. I hope you find this project informative and enjoyable to work with.
